 Airlines-Data-Analysis-Project

✈️ Airline Occupancy & Revenue Optimization

 Overview

This project analyzes airline operations to identify ways to improve **occupancy rates**, **pricing strategies**, and overall **profitability**. Using SQL and Python, I explore real-world airline data stored in a `SQLite` database to extract actionable business insights.

Objectives

- Boost occupancy rates on underperforming flights
- Optimize pricing across fare classes
- Analyze revenue trends and booking behavior

Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQLite (via `sqlite3`)
- Jupyter Notebook

Data Sources

The data is stored in a `travel.sqlite` file with tables like:
- `flights`, `bookings`, `tickets`, `boarding_passes`
- `seats`, `aircrafts_data`

Queried directly using SQL and analyzed in Python.

Key Insights
- Certain aircraft types have low occupancy and revenue
- Business class pricing consistently exceeds economy
- A simulated 10% occupancy increase showed notable revenue gains
- Recommendations made for pricing and route strategy
